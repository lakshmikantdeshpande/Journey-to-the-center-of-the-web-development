		--main-background-color: coral
	Usage:
		div {
			background-color: var(--main-background-color, gray)  // gray is a fallback value (it's optional)
			// background-color: var(--main-background-color) 
		}

** :root 
root selector is applied everywhere


** Media queries

	:root {
      --penguin-size: 200px;
      --penguin-skin: black;

* Normal flow: It's the normal flow (position) of elements which is present in the webpage.
	position: relative   => will make the current element move around considering the position of the elements that are around it.
	[ In short everything around the element will stay, and the element will move around. ]

	Two relative elements will overlap according to the order of their presence in the code.

* top bottom left right: These attributes push an element away from given edge

* Absolute position: If we are using absolute position, we should add relative position to the parent tag. If not added, it'll keep going up the hierarchy until body tag is found.
