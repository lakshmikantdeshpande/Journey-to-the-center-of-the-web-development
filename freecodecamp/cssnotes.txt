** margin for external spacing


**CSS Priorities
0. !important attribute (Although it doesn't work with body tag)
1. inline style
2. id style
2. own class (If there are multiple classes, it chooses the class which appears first in style tag)

**var() in css
variables must be defined starting with -- and they are case sensitive
Syntax:
	Declaration:
		--main-background-color: coral
	Usage:
		div {
			background-color: var(--main-background-color, gray)  // gray is a fallback value (it's optional)
			// background-color: var(--main-background-color) 
		}

** :root 
root selector is applied everywhere


** Media queries
@media(max-width: 350px) {
    :root {
      --penguin-size: 200px;
      --penguin-skin: black;  
    }
}
This query will change css when screen width <= 350 px;

* Normal flow: It's the normal flow (position) of elements which is present in the webpage.
	position: relative   => will make the current element move around considering the position of the elements that are around it.
	[ In short everything around the element will stay, and the element will move around. ]

	Two relative elements will overlap according to the order of their presence in the code.

* top bottom left right: These attributes push an element away from given edge

* Absolute position: If we are using absolute position, we should add relative position to the parent tag. If not added, it'll keep going up the hierarchy until body tag is found.

* fixed | relative | absolute
Fixed position is similar to absolute. The only difference is that the element will stay even after scrolling.

* float: Elements are removed from the normal flow of the webpage, and moved around according to the value.
	eg. float: right;  will make an element move to the right, and it'll be removed from the normal flow in the process.

* z-index: It allows us to put elements one onto another. For doing this, make the parent tag as relative, mark the elements with absolute positioning, and apply z-index property to overlay an element onto another.


* margin: auto;  centers an element horizontally.
