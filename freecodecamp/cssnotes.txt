**Selectors using attributes

[type='radio'] {
margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;
}


** padding for internal spacing


** margin for external spacing


**CSS Priorities
0. !important attribute (Although it doesn't work with body tag)
1. inline style
2. id style
2. own class (If there are multiple classes, it chooses the class which appears first in style tag)
3. body / parent class


**var() in css
variables must be defined starting with -- and they are case sensitive
Syntax:
	Declaration:
		--main-background-color: coral
	Usage:
		div {
			background-color: var(--main-background-color, gray)  // gray is a fallback value (it's optional)
			// background-color: var(--main-background-color) 
		}

** :root 
root selector is applied everywhere


** Media queries
@media(max-width: 350px) {
    :root {
      --penguin-size: 200px;
      --penguin-skin: black;  
    }
}
This query will change css when screen width <= 350 px;

** <strong> is converted to font-weight: bold by browsers
** <em> is converted to font-style: italic by browsers
** <del> is converted to text-decoration: strikethrough by browsers

** <hr> for a horizontal line

** text-transform property is used to convert the text to different cases:
	lowercase uppercase initial capitalize inherit none

** line-height: to set height of a line in text

** Pseudo classes: the classes which get applied on change of a state in the element
eg. hover

* Normal flow: It's the normal flow (position) of elements which is present in the webpage.
	position: relative   => will make the current element move around considering the position of the elements that are around it.
	[ In short everything around the element will stay, and the element will move around. ]

	Two relative elements will overlap according to the order of their presence in the code.

* top bottom left right: These attributes push an element away from given edge

* Absolute position: If we are using absolute position, we should add relative position to the parent tag. If not added, it'll keep going up the hierarchy until body tag is found.

* fixed | relative | absolute
Fixed position is similar to absolute. The only difference is that the element will stay even after scrolling.

* float: Elements are removed from the normal flow of the webpage, and moved around according to the value.
	eg. float: right;  will make an element move to the right, and it'll be removed from the normal flow in the process.

* z-index: It allows us to put elements one onto another. For doing this, make the parent tag as relative, mark the elements with absolute positioning, and apply z-index property to overlay an element onto another.


* margin: auto;  centers an element horizontally.

* Complementary colors:
	the colors which are present opposite to each other in color wheel are complementry colors.
	It's good to use complementary colors to have contrast in the application.


* hsl()   Hue, Saturation, and Lightness
eg. red	hsl(0, 100%, 50%)


* Linear gradient: Use it for color gradient.
eg. background: linear-gradient(35deg, #CCFFFF, #FFCCCC);

* Repeated linear gradient: for creating stripes..
eg. background: repeating-linear-gradient(
      45deg,
      yellow 0px,
      yellow 40px,
      black 40px,
      black 80px
    );

* background image 
eg. background: url("http:ASDFasdfasdf.acsomasdc");

****************************************************************************************

* CSS Transform
The following css snippet will scale the div up by 10% when one hovers over it.
	div:hover {
	    transform: scale(1.1);
	  }
 Other functions are skewX, skewY, scale, rotate etc.



* Animations

#anim {
  animation-name: rainbow; 
  animation-duration: 3s;
}
@keyframes rainbow {
  0% {                          // which property needs to be applied at 0% of animation duration
    background-color: blue;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
}

animation-iteration-count: infinite;  // makes the animation play infinitely.
animation-timing-function: ease-out;  // defines timing function of an animation (eg. linear, cubic-bezier)

Accessibility tips

* Always use 'alt' attribute (useful for screen readers). Keep it blank for decorative images.
* Use markup tags to make the data meaningful. eg. <main> <header> <nav> <footer> <article> <section>

* Audio   Embed audio player in the webpage
eg.	
	<audio id="meowClip" controls>
	  <source src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
	</audio>


* Figure
We should use figure tag to include figures in the webpage.
eg. <figure>
		<img src="abc.jpg" alt="abc">
		<br>
		<figcaption>ABC</figcaption>
	</figure>

* fieldset
	<form> <fieldset> <!-- controls --> </fieldset> </form>

* time 
	Time tag is used to let the browser know that enclosed content is time.
 eg. <time datetime="2018-07-18"> Today </time>

* Accessibility
	Hide elements for screen readers by using the following kind of a css:
	.sr-only {
	  position: absolute;
	  left: -10000px;
	  width: 1px;
	  height: 1px;
	  top: auto;
	  overflow: hidden;
	}

* High contrast readability
	WCAG recommends at least 4.5 : 1 ratio for luminance for readability

* accesskey   (Shortcut key for buttons / links)
	We can add accesskey to links / buttons

* tabindex 
	- if it is -1, it means it is focusable, but not reachable by keyboard
	- it also enables :focus pseudo class for use
