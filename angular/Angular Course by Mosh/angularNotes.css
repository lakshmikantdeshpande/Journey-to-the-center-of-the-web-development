** Attribute binding
<img [src]="imageURL"> OR  <img src="{{ imageURL }}">

** Class binding
<div [class.active]="isActive">  // will refer to isActive variable in typescript, and add/remove active class accordingly

** Style binding
<button [style.backgroundColor]="buttonColor"> // will refer to buttonColor variable in typescript

** Missing properties for binding
we'll have to use such kind of syntax: [attrs.colspan]
