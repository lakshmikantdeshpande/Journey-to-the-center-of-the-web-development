** Attribute binding
<img [src]="imageURL"> OR  <img src="{{ imageURL }}">

** Class binding
<div [class.active]="isActive">  // will refer to isActive variable in typescript, and add/remove active class accordingly

** Style binding
<button [style.backgroundColor]="buttonColor"> // will refer to buttonColor variable in typescript

** Event binding
<button (click)="onSave($event)"> // calls onClick method in typescript
onSave($event) {
	$event.stopPropogation(); // avoids event bubbling
	console.log("button was clicked");
}

** Event filtering
<button (keyup)="onSave($event)">
onSave($event) {
	if ($event.keyCode === 13)
		console.log("Enter was pressed");
}

OR 

<button (keyup.enter)="onSave()">



** Template variables
<input #email (keyup.enter)="onSave(email.value)">  // #email references to this email input box


** 2 way binding
<input [(ngModel)]="email" (keyup.enter)="onSave()">  
// We need to add FormsModule to imports section in app.module.ts


** Missing properties for binding
we'll have to use such kind of syntax: [attrs.colspan]


** Input  (for attributes)
Mark the attributes which needs to be injected from HTML to TS file with @Input
eg. app.component.ts    has isFavorite boolean property
    app.component.html  has <favorite [isFavorite]="isFavorite"> tag

    then
    
    favorite.component.ts   should have isFavorite boolean property 
    @Input() isFavorite: boolean


** Output  (for events)
To emit change events from one component to another
eg. app.component.ts 
	isFavorite: boolean = true;
	markFavorite() {
		console.log("Favorite is changed");
	}

    app.component.html
	<app-favorite (change)="markFavorite()" [isFavorite]="isFavorite"></app-favorite>
	// here change is event which gets emmitted from favorite component, and it's annotated with @Output()
	// isFavorite is input property annotated with @Input()  or @Input("isFavorite")

    favorite.component.ts
	@Input() isFavorite: boolean;
	@Output() change = new EventEmitter();

	markFavorite() {
		this.isFavorite = !this.isFavorite;
	}

    favorite.component.html
	<span (click)="markFavorite()">
		Favorite {{ isFavorite ? "works" : "doesn't work" }}
	</span>
